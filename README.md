A very simple 6502 based single board computer with just about as much chips as is needed as minimum.

- 6502 CPU
- 8kB EPROM for Firmware
- Up to 48kB RAM comprised from maximum of 6x 8kB SRAM chips
- 8kB reserved I/O area with 1kB blocks having the following;
  - 6551 ACIA for rs232 with max233 level translator
- Two TTL decoder chips for memory mapping.

Initial design of this board was drawn by hand to pieces of paper some 25+ years ago. What you see here is 
an attempt to capture that design into digital form using KiCAD with intentionally not making changes to it if possible.
